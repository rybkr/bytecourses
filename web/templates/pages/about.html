        <h1>About ByteCourses</h1>
        <p class="lead">A platform where students teach students, creating a community of peer-to-peer learning and
            knowledge sharing.</p>

        <section class="about-section">
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>ByteCourses was born from a simple observation: some of the most valuable learning happens when students
                teach each other. Traditional education often moves too slowly or focuses too broadly, while
                professional courses can be expensive and disconnected from the student experience.</p>
            <p>We believe that students who have mastered specialized skills have unique insights to share—they
                understand the challenges, know what actually works, and can teach in ways that resonate with their
                peers. ByteCourses creates a space where this knowledge can be shared through short, focused courses.

                teach. We're building a platform that makes it easy to share knowledge, learn practical skills, and grow
                together as a community.</p>

            <h2>How We Work</h2>
            <p>ByteCourses operates on a simple model:</p>
            <ol class="about-list">
                <li><strong>Instructors submit proposals</strong> for courses they want to teach, outlining the content,
                    structure, and learning outcomes.</li>
                <li><strong>Our team reviews proposals</strong> to ensure they meet quality standards and provide value
                    to learners.</li>
                <li><strong>Approved courses go live</strong>, where students can discover, enroll, and learn at their
                    own pace.</li>
                <li><strong>Students build skills</strong> through structured modules, readings, and practical content
                    designed by their peers.</li>
            </ol>
